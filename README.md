# CombinationalCircuitBuilder
This repository stores the files for my Combinational Circuit Builder program.
The Combinational Circuit Builder is a program written in Java that allows the user to build combinational circuits with the provided logic gates.
This program allows the user to build, test and record the results of a combinational circuit of any complexity.

State of the program: NOT COMPLETE. The program is lacking a user interface which will be made soon.
